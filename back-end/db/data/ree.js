    description: 'A vegan take on the classic English breakfast that boasts vegan sausages with hash browns, mushrooms, tomatoes, scrambled tofu and baked beans',
    ingredients: ['1 large potato', '1 ½ tbsp peanut butter', '14 cherry tomatoes', 'sunflower oil', 
      '2 tsp maple syrup', '1 tsp soy sauce', '¼ tsp smoked paprika', '1 large Portobello mushroom, sliced', 
      '349g pack silken tofu', '2 tbsp nutritional yeast', '½ tsp tumeric', '1 clove garlic, crushed', 
      '4 vegan sausages (we used Richmonds Meat Free Ones)', '1 x 200g can baked beans' ],
    method: ['Cook the potato whole in a large pan of water, boil for 10 mins then drain and allow to cool. Peel the skin away then coarsely grate. Mix with the peanut butter and season well. Set aside in the fridge until needed.', 
      'Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the cherry tomatoes onto a baking tray, drizzle with 2 tsp sunflower oil, season and bake for 30 mins or until the skins have blistered and start to char. Cook the beans and sausages following the instructions on the pack so theyre ready to serve at the same time as the scrambled tofu.', 
      'Meanwhile, mix the maple syrup, soy sauce and ¼ tsp smoked paprika together in a large bowl, add the sliced mushroom and toss to coat in the mixture. Leave to stand while you pour 2 tsp sunflower oil into a non-stick frying pan and bring it up to a medium high heat. Fry the mushroom until just starting to turn golden but not charred. Scoop onto a plate and keep warm until serving.', 
      'Put 1 tbsp oil into the frying pan and add spoonfuls of the potato mixture – you should get about 4. Fry for 3-4 mins each side then drain onto kitchen paper.', 'Crumble the tofu into your frying pan and sprinkle over the remaining ingredients and a good pinch of salt and pepper. If the pan looks a little dry add a splash more oil. Fry for 3-4 mins or until the tofu is broken into pieces, well coated in the seasoning and hot through.', 
      'Divide everything between 2 plates and serve with a hot mug of tea made using soy milk.'],

    description: 'Vegans neednt miss out on pizza Margherita. Our recipe combines the classic flavours of this Italian comfort food using plant-based substitutes',
    ingredients: ['500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting', '1 tsp dried yeast', 
      '1 tsp caster sugar', '1 ½ tbsp olive oil, plus extra', '100ml passata', 
      '1 tbsp fresh basil, chopped (or 1/2 tsp dried oregano)', '1 garlic clove, crushed', 
      '200g vegan mozzarella-style cheese, grated', '2 tomatoes, thinly sliced', 
      'Fresh basil or oregano leaves, chilli oil and vegan parmesan to serve (optional)' ],
    method: ['Put the flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Measure 150ml of cold water and 150ml boiling water into a jug and mix them together – this will mean your water is a good temperature for the yeast. Add the oil and 1 tsp salt to the warm water then pour it over the flour. Stir well with a spoon then start to knead the mixture together in the bowl until it forms a soft and slightly sticky dough. If it’s too dry add a splash of cold water.', 
      'Dust a little flour on the work surface and knead the dough for 10 mins. Put it back in the mixing bowl and cover with cling film greased with a few drops of olive oil. Leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size.', 'Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 9 and put a baking sheet or pizza stone on the top shelf to heat up. Once the dough has risen, knock it back by punching it a couple of times with your fist then kneading it again on a floured surface. It should be springy and a lot less sticky. Set aside while you prepare the sauce.', 
      'Put all the ingredients for the tomato sauce together in a bowl, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar if you like and mix well. Set aside until needed.', '(depending on whether you want to make large or small pizzas), shape into balls and flatten each piece out as thin as you can get it with a rolling pin or using your hands. Make sure the dough is well dusted with flour to stop it sticking. Dust another baking sheet with flour then put a pizza base on top – spread 4-5 tbsp of the tomato sauce on top and add some sliced tomatoes and grated vegan cheese. Drizzle with a little olive oil and bake in the oven on top of your preheated baking tray for 10-12 mins or until the base is puffed up and the vegan cheese has melted and is bubbling and golden in patches.', 
      'Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping. Serve the pizzas with fresh basil leaves or chilli oil if you like and sprinkle over vegan parmesan just after baking.'],
